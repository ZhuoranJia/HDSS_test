# IFC2HCM: a tool for generating hospital configuration models from IFC BIM data models
IFC2HCM is a novel software tool designed to generate IndoorGML and Hospital Configuration Models (HCM) from IFC/BIM models. The primary motivation behind IFC2HCM is to develop a tool for generating HCM as the core foundation of the Hospital Design Support System (HDSS) that will evaluate hopsital layout design in terms of operational efficiency. The software addresses the need for detailed spatial network analysis and simulation modelling in complex hospital environments, offering a semi-automatic process to convert IFC data into IndoorGML, and subsequently into a comprehensive HCM. The HCM generated by this tool, consisted of geometric, topological, semantic, and operational information, supports applications such as space optimization, facility management, ensuring safety, and indoor navigation. 
## Software used: Python, Autodesk’s Revit and Dynamo, McNeel’s Rhino and Grasshopper
## Dependencies: Dependencies for Python: pandas, NumPy, COMPAS, Matplotlib, NetworkX, LXML. Dependencies for Grasshopper: Human, LunchBox, LunchBoxML.
## How to use: 
1. Import any IFC model into the geometry_software to extract data. 
2. Process the extracted data in csv processor and generate IndoorGML using IndoorGML generator.
3. Import Generated IndoorGML file into HCM generator to generte HCM.
